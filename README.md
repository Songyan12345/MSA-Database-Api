#### Notes:
* When POSTing (adding) a new Address without a specified Student, a new Student entity is automatically created. This is because an Address should not exist within a Student database if there are no Students that live at the Address
* When PUTting (modifying) a Student or Address entity, the respective **id** to be changed must be declared both as an input parameter and as a parameter for the **id** attribute within the request body. If either values are not present, or the two values are not equal, it will result in an error
